# Lesson 2: Active Galactic Nuclei

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent the most luminous persistent objects in the universe, powered by supermassive black holes that convert gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation with unprecedented efficiency.

## Learning Objectives
Students will understand the unified model explaining AGN diversity through viewing angles and environmental effects. They will learn about different active galaxy types and explore black hole accretion physics that generates enormous luminosities visible across cosmic distances.

## AGN Classification

Active galactic nuclei encompass diverse objects united by supermassive black holes ranging from millions to billions of solar masses. These engines often outshine their host galaxies containing hundreds of billions of stars.

### Seyfert Galaxies
Seyfert galaxies represent the most common nearby active galaxies in spiral hosts. Type 1 Seyferts display broad and narrow emission lines, indicating gas moving at 10,000 km/s near the black hole and slower gas farther out. Type 2 Seyferts show only narrow lines, suggesting dusty material obscures our view of the broad line region. These moderate-luminosity sources (~10⁴⁴ erg/s) provide excellent nearby laboratories for AGN physics.

### Quasars
Quasars earned their name from star-like appearances despite being the most distant luminous objects known. They emit over 10⁴⁶ erg/s, requiring billion-solar-mass black holes accreting at maximum rates. Their broad emission lines reveal gas velocities reaching tens of thousands of km/s near intense gravitational fields.

### Radio Galaxies
Radio galaxies launch relativistic particle jets extending millions of light-years, maintaining collimation over enormous distances before terminating in bright lobes. The Fanaroff-Riley classification distinguishes FR I edge-darkened jets from FR II edge-brightened sources with prominent hotspots. These typically reside in massive elliptical galaxies.

### Blazars
Blazars occur when relativistic jets point toward Earth, causing dramatic Doppler boosting that amplifies luminosity and compresses variability timescales. They show highly polarized synchrotron emission and significant gamma-ray radiation, providing insights into particle acceleration in relativistic jets under extreme conditions.
