# Lesson 4: Small Solar System Bodies

This lesson explores asteroids, comets, and other small bodies that offer vital clues about the formation and evolution of the solar system.

Asteroids are primarily rocky and metallic objects that mostly reside in the Main Belt between Mars and Jupiter. Their sizes vary from tiny dust particles to large bodies like Ceres, which spans about 940 kilometers. Many belong to asteroid families formed by past collisions.

Near-Earth asteroids come close to Earthâ€™s orbit and can pose impact threats, such as the Tunguska and Chicxulub events. They are studied in planetary defense efforts and targeted by missions for sample return.

Comets are icy bodies originating from the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. Kuiper Belt Objects include short-period comets with orbits under 200 years, like Pluto, which is the largest known KBO. The Oort Cloud holds long-period comets with isotropic orbits, often perturbed by nearby stars.

These small bodies play crucial roles in tracing planetary history and assessing future risks.
