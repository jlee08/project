# Lesson 2: Atmospheres and Climates

This lesson examines planetary atmospheres and climates through comparative analysis of different worlds, revealing how atmospheric composition, structure, and evolution processes determine planetary climate systems and habitability.

## Learning Objectives
Students will understand how atmospheric composition and structure vary across planetary bodies and the physical processes governing these differences. They will learn about atmospheric evolution mechanisms including escape processes, outgassing, and chemical reactions that transform planetary atmospheres over geological time. The lesson explores climate systems on different planets, demonstrating how similar physical principles produce dramatically different environmental outcomes.

## Atmospheric Origins and Composition

Planetary atmospheres originate through two distinct mechanisms that operated at different times during solar system evolution, creating the diverse atmospheric compositions observed today.

### Primary Atmospheres
Primary atmospheres formed when planets captured gases directly from the solar nebula during their formation period. Gas giants successfully retained these hydrogen and helium dominated atmospheres due to their massive sizes and cold formation environments beyond the snow line. However, terrestrial planets lost their primordial atmospheres through various escape processes including thermal escape driven by early solar heating, impact erosion during the Late Heavy Bombardment, and hydrodynamic escape caused by enhanced solar activity during the young Sun's T-Tauri phase.

### Secondary Atmospheres
Secondary atmospheres developed after primary atmosphere loss through outgassing from planetary interiors during volcanic activity and impact degassing when comets and asteroids delivered volatiles to planetary surfaces. These processes released water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and noble gases trapped within planetary materials during formation. Atmospheric evolution continued through billions of years of chemical and physical processes including photochemistry, surface-atmosphere interactions, and continued atmospheric escape, producing the current atmospheric compositions that reflect each planet's unique evolutionary history.

## Comparative Climate Systems

The greenhouse effect operates on all planets with substantial atmospheres, but its magnitude and consequences vary dramatically depending on atmospheric composition, pressure, and stellar heating, creating the diverse climate conditions observed across the solar system.

### Earth's Balanced System
Earth maintains a moderate greenhouse effect providing approximately 33 K of surface warming, keeping global temperatures within ranges suitable for liquid water. Water vapor creates positive feedback loops that amplify climate changes, while the carbon cycle provides long-term climate regulation through weathering processes that remove excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Plate tectonics helps regulate this system by recycling carbon through subduction and volcanic outgassing, maintaining the delicate balance necessary for habitability over geological timescales.

### Venus's Runaway Greenhouse
Venus demonstrates extreme greenhouse warming with surface temperatures reaching 462Â°C due to its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere maintaining 92 bar surface pressure. The planet's proximity to the Sun likely triggered runaway greenhouse conditions where increasing temperatures caused ocean evaporation, releasing more water vapor that enhanced greenhouse warming until all water was lost to space through UV photolysis and hydrogen escape. Sulfuric acid clouds create additional complications, producing a corrosive environment while contributing to the planet's high albedo.

### Mars's Atmospheric Loss
Mars exhibits the consequences of small planetary mass and greater solar distance through its thin atmosphere containing only 0.6% of Earth's surface pressure. The carbon dioxide dominated atmosphere creates seasonal polar caps that exchange material with the atmosphere, while evidence from ancient river valleys and lake beds suggests the planet once possessed a much thicker atmosphere capable of supporting liquid water. Progressive atmospheric loss through solar wind stripping and thermal escape has created the current cold, dry conditions despite ongoing seasonal and possibly longer-term climate variations.
