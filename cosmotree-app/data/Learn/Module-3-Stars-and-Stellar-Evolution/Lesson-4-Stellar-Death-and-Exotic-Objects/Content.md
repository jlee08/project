# Lesson 4: Stellar Death and Exotic Objects

Stellar death depends critically on mass. Low-mass stars (< 8 solar masses) shed their outer layers as planetary nebulae, leaving behind white dwarf remnants supported by electron degeneracy pressure. High-mass stars (> 8 solar masses) undergo core collapse when nuclear fuel is exhausted, leading to supernova explosions that either create neutron stars or, for the most massive stars (> 25 solar masses), black holes. These processes disperse heavy elements forged in stellar cores throughout the universe, enriching the interstellar medium. Neutron star mergers produce gravitational waves detectable by LIGO and create kilonovae that synthesize the heaviest elements.
