# Lesson 3: Main Sequence Evolution

During the main sequence phase, stars spend most of their lives fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium between gravitational collapse and radiation pressure. Low-mass stars use the proton-proton chain reaction, while more massive stars (>1.3 solar masses) primarily use the CNO cycle, which is more temperature-sensitive and efficient. Stellar mass determines lifetime - massive stars burn fuel quickly and live only millions of years, while low-mass stars can shine for trillions of years. As core hydrogen depletes, stars begin to evolve off the main sequence toward the red giant phase.
