# Lesson 1: Properties of Stars

Stars are massive balls of gas held together by gravity and powered by nuclear fusion in their cores. They vary enormously in size, mass, temperature, and brightness. Astronomers classify stars by their surface temperature using spectral classes O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, from hottest to coolest. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram plots stars by temperature and luminosity, revealing the main sequence where most stars spend their lives. Star properties are interconnected - more massive stars are hotter, brighter, and evolve faster than less massive ones.
