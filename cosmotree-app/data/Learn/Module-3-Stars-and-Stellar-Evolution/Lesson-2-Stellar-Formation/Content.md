# Lesson 2: Stellar Formation

Stars form when giant clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds collapse under their own gravity. The process begins in cold, dense regions where gravity overcomes the outward pressure from gas motion and radiation. As the cloud contracts, it fragments into smaller clumps that continue collapsing to form protostars. These protostars gradually heat up as they contract until their cores become hot enough to ignite nuclear fusion, marking their birth as true stars. The entire process takes millions of years and often occurs in star-forming regions like the Orion Nebula.
