# Lesson 1: Detection Methods

Exoplanets are detected using several methods: transit photometry measures brightness dimming when planets cross their stars, radial velocity detects stellar wobble from planetary gravity, direct imaging captures planet light after blocking starlight, and gravitational microlensing uses Einstein's lensing effects. Each method provides different information - transits give radius, radial velocity gives mass, and combining methods enables complete characterization.

## 4. Future Prospects and Technological Developments

The field of exoplanet detection continues to evolve rapidly, with new technologies and observational strategies pushing the boundaries of what is possible and opening new avenues for discovery and characterization. Next-generation ground-based telescopes, including the Extremely Large Telescope class observatories with primary mirrors 25-40 meters in diameter, will provide unprecedented light-gathering power and angular resolution for direct imaging of exoplanets. These facilities will be equipped with advanced adaptive optics systems and coronagraphic instruments capable of detecting and studying Earth-like planets around nearby stars.

Space-based missions offer unique advantages for exoplanet detection and characterization, free from atmospheric turbulence and capable of observing continuously for extended periods. Future missions like the James Webb Space Telescope are already revolutionizing our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres through transmission and emission spectroscopy, while proposed missions such as HabEx and LUVOIR could directly image potentially habitable exoplanets and search for biosignatures in their atmospheres.

The development of new detection techniques continues to expand the toolkit available for exoplanet science. Machine learning algorithms are being applied to extract planetary signals from noisy data, while new approaches such as radio emission detection and reflected light phase curves are providing additional ways to study distant worlds. These technological advances promise to transform our understanding of planetary systems and may ultimately answer the fundamental question of whether life exists elsewhere in the universe.
