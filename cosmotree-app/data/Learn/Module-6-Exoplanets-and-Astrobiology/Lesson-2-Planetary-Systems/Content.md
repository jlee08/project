# Lesson 2: Planetary Systems

Exoplanetary systems show remarkable diversity compared to our solar system. Hot Jupiters are giant planets orbiting very close to their stars, super-Earths are planets between Earth and Neptune size, compact multiples have many planets tightly packed together, and eccentric giants have highly elliptical orbits. Planet migration and dynamical interactions explain these unexpected architectures.
