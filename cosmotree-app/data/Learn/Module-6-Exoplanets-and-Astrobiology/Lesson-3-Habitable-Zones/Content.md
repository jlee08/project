# Lesson 3: Habitable Zones

The habitable zone is the orbital distance range where liquid water can exist on a planet's surface. It depends on stellar luminosity, planetary atmosphere, and orbital characteristics. M dwarf stars have close habitable zones with tidally locked planets, while K dwarfs may be optimal "Goldilocks stars." The zone evolves as stars change brightness over time.
