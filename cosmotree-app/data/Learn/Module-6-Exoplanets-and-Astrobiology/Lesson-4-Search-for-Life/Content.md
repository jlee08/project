# Lesson 4: Search for Life

Scientists search for life through biosignatures like oxygen, ozone, and methane in exoplanet atmospheres using transmission spectroscopy and direct imaging. SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) looks for radio signals and technosignatures like megastructures. Future missions will specialize in detecting biosignatures, though false positives from abiotic processes remain a challenge.
