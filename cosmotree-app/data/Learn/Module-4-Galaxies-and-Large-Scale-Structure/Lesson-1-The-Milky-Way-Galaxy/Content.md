# Lesson 1: The Milky Way Galaxy

The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy (SBbc type) containing approximately 400 billion stars within a disk roughly 100,000 light-years in diameter. Our solar system is located about 26,000 light-years from the galactic center in the Orion Arm, a minor spiral feature between the major Perseus and Sagittarius arms. The galaxy's structure includes a thin disk containing young stars and gas, a thick disk with older stellar populations, a central bulge and bar, and an extended stellar halo containing globular clusters. At the very center lies Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole with 4 million solar masses. Dark matter comprises about 85% of the galaxy's total mass, providing the gravitational framework that holds everything together.
