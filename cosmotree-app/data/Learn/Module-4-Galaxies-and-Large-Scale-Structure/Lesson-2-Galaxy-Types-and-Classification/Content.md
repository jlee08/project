# Lesson 2: Galaxy Types and Classification

The Hubble sequence classifies galaxies into ellipticals (E0-E7), spirals (Sa-Sc), and irregulars, with lenticulars (S0) as an intermediate type. Elliptical galaxies are smooth, red systems dominated by old stellar populations with little gas or active star formation. Spiral galaxies feature rotating disks with spiral arms where ongoing star formation creates young, blue stellar populations. Barred spirals (SBa-SBc) have central bars that drive gas inward and influence spiral structure. Irregular galaxies lack organized structure but show active star formation and are often gas-rich. Modern classification incorporates color-magnitude diagrams distinguishing red sequence galaxies from blue cloud galaxies, and environmental effects that influence morphology through processes like ram pressure stripping in galaxy clusters.
