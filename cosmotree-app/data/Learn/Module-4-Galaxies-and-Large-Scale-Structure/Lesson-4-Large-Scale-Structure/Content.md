# Lesson 4: Large-Scale Structure

The cosmic web represents the largest-scale structure in the universe, consisting of galaxy clusters, filaments, walls, and voids arranged in a web-like pattern spanning hundreds of megaparsecs. Galaxy clusters contain hundreds to thousands of galaxies embedded in hot X-ray emitting gas and dominated by dark matter, with total masses of 10^14-10^15 solar masses. Filaments are linear structures connecting clusters where galaxies flow along the cosmic web. Cosmic voids are enormous nearly empty regions occupying ~80% of space with densities less than 10% of the cosmic average. This structure formed through gravitational instability acting on primordial density fluctuations from inflation, with dark matter providing the scaffolding for ordinary matter to follow. Observations from redshift surveys like SDSS have mapped this cosmic web in unprecedented detail.
