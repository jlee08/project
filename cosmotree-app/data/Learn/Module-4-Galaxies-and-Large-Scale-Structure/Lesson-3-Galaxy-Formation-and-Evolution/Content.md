# Lesson 3: Galaxy Formation and Evolution

Galaxies form through hierarchical structure formation from primordial density fluctuations in the early universe. Small dark matter halos merge to build larger structures in a bottom-up process described by the Lambda-CDM model. Galaxy evolution is driven by star formation, stellar and AGN feedback, environmental effects, and major/minor mergers. The cosmic star formation rate peaked at redshift z~2-3 when the universe was young and gas-rich. Supermassive black holes coevolve with their host galaxies, regulated by feedback processes that establish scaling relations like the M-Ïƒ relation. Environmental processes such as ram pressure stripping, tidal interactions, and galaxy harassment significantly affect evolution, explaining the morphology-density relation observed in galaxy clusters versus field environments.
