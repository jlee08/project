# Lesson 4: Tools and Methods of Astronomy

Astronomers use telescopes and advanced technology to study the universe across all types of light and radiation. Ground-based telescopes are large and cost-effective, while space telescopes avoid atmospheric interference and can see wavelengths blocked by Earth's atmosphere. Different types of light reveal different cosmic phenomena - radio waves show pulsars and quasars, infrared reveals cool objects and star formation, while X-rays expose the most energetic events like black holes. Modern techniques like spectroscopy analyze starlight to determine composition and temperature, while computers help process vast amounts of data and simulate cosmic events we cannot directly observe.
