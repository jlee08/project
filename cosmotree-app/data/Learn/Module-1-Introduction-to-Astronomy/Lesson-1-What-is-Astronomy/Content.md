# Lesson 1: What is Astronomy?

Astronomy is the science of studying the universe beyond Earth, including stars, planets, and galaxies. It seeks to understand the origins, structure, and evolution of the cosmos through observation and theory. From ancient times, astronomy has helped humans measure time, navigate, and explore our place in the universe. Today, it uses advanced technology to answer fundamental questions about the nature of space, time, and existence. Unlike astrology, which is not scientific, astronomy relies on evidence and the scientific method. Its discoveries continue to inspire curiosity and drive innovation, shaping our understanding of the world and our future.
