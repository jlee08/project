# Lesson 3: Scale and Structure of the Universe

The universe is vast, with distances and structures far beyond everyday experience. From planets and stars to galaxies and superclusters, everything is organized in a cosmic hierarchy. Astronomers use units like the astronomical unit, light-year, and parsec to measure these immense scales. The observable universe stretches about 46 billion light-years in every direction, but the true universe may be even larger. Despite our tiny size, humanity’s ability to measure and understand these scales is a remarkable achievement. Our planet is a small part of a much greater cosmic web, and our curiosity connects us to the universe’s grand story.
