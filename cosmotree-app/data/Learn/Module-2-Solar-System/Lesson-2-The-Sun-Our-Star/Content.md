# Lesson 2: The Sun - Our Star

The Sun is a middle-aged, average-sized star powered by nuclear fusion at its core. Composed of 73% hydrogen and 25% helium, the Sun converts 4 million tons of matter into energy each second through fusion reactions. Its layers include the core where fusion occurs, radiative and convective zones that transport energy outward, the photosphere we see as the surface, and the corona extending into space. Solar activity includes sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections that affect Earth's magnetic field and space weather.
