# Lesson 4: Gas Giant Planets

The gas giant planets - Jupiter and Saturn - are massive worlds composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter, the largest planet, protects the inner solar system from comets and asteroids with its powerful gravity. Saturn is famous for its spectacular ring system. These planets formed beyond the "snow line" where ice could condense, allowing them to grow large enough to capture gas directly from the solar nebula. They have many moons, including some with potential for life like Europa and Enceladus, which harbor subsurface oceans.
