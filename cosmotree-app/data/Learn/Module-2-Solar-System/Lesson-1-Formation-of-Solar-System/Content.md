# Lesson 1: Formation of Solar System

Our solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. As this cloud collapsed under gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk with the Sun forming at the center. In the inner regions where it was hot, only rocky materials could condense, forming the terrestrial planets. Beyond the "snow line" where it was cold enough for ice to form, larger planets could grow and capture gas, becoming the giant planets. Evidence for this theory comes from studying meteorites, observing young star systems, and analyzing the patterns we see in our solar system today.
