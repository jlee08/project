# Lesson 3: Terrestrial Planets

The terrestrial planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars - are the rocky worlds closest to the Sun. These planets formed in the hot inner solar system where only rocks and metals could condense. Despite their similar compositions, they evolved very differently: Mercury is airless and cratered, Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect with crushing atmosphere, Earth maintains perfect conditions for life with liquid water, and Mars is cold and dry with evidence of past water activity. Understanding these differences helps us appreciate what makes Earth special.
