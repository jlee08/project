# Lesson 2: Cosmic Microwave Background

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is thermal radiation released during recombination ~380,000 years after the Big Bang when electrons and protons first combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms, making the universe transparent. Discovered accidentally by Penzias and Wilson in 1965, the CMB appears as nearly perfect blackbody radiation at 2.725 K filling all of space. Precision observations by COBE, WMAP, and Planck satellites revealed tiny temperature fluctuations of ~10^-5 that represent primordial density variations from quantum fluctuations during inflation. These anisotropies provided the seeds for all cosmic structure formation. The CMB power spectrum constrains fundamental cosmological parameters including the geometry of space, matter and dark energy densities, and confirms the standard cosmological model with remarkable precision.
