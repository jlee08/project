# Lesson 4: The Fate of the Universe

The universe's fate depends on dark energy's nature. Current observations favor eternal expansion leading to heat death, where stars die and black holes eventually evaporate. Alternative scenarios include the Big Crunch (gravitational collapse), Big Rip (phantom dark energy tears everything apart), or cyclic models with repeated Big Bang-Big Crunch cycles.
