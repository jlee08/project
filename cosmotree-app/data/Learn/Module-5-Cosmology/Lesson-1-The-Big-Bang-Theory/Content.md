# Lesson 1: The Big Bang Theory

The Big Bang theory describes the universe beginning 13.8 billion years ago from an extremely hot, dense state and expanding while cooling ever since. Key evidence includes Hubble's discovery of cosmic expansion showing distant galaxies receding faster, the cosmic microwave background radiation as a relic from when the universe became transparent at 380,000 years, and Big Bang nucleosynthesis accurately predicting the observed abundances of light elements (75% hydrogen, 25% helium). The universe evolved through distinct epochs: cosmic inflation explaining uniformity and flatness, nucleosynthesis creating light elements in the first 20 minutes, and recombination when neutral atoms formed. This standard Lambda-CDM model successfully explains observations while raising questions about dark matter and dark energy.
