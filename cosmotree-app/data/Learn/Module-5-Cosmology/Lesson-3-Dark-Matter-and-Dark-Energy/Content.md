# Lesson 3: Dark Matter and Dark Energy

Dark matter comprises 27% of the universe and only interacts gravitationally, evidenced by galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and cluster dynamics. Dark energy makes up 68% of the universe and causes accelerating expansion, discovered through Type Ia supernovae observations. Leading candidates include WIMPs for dark matter and the cosmological constant for dark energy.
